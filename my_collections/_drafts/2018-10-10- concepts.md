## Regression to the mean

- In any series with complex phenomena that are dependent on many variables, where chance is involved, extreme outcomes tend to be followed by more moderate ones.
- Extreme performance tends to get less extreme the next time. Why? Testing measurements can never be exact. All measurements are made up of one true part and one random error part. When the measurements are extreme, they are likely to be partly caused by chance. Chance is likely to contribute less on the second time we measure performance.
If we switch from one way of doing something to another merely because we are unsuccessful, itâ€™s very likely that we do better the next time even if the new way of doing something is equal or worse.
